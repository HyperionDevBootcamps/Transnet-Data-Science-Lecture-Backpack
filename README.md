This rest of the repository is structured into five main folders, each dedicated to a specific week in the Data Science bootcamp. This stream offers a comprehensive introduction to data science, covering fundamental programming skills, data manipulation, and advanced machine learning techniques. It includes:

- **Python Fundamentals**: Basics of Python, including data types, conditional statements, loops, and functions.
- **Data Management**: Using Pandas for data manipulation, handling datasets, and performing data analysis and visualization with Matplotlib and Seaborn.
- **Data Analysis and Visualization**: Techniques for data cleaning, preprocessing, and visualization to uncover insights and communicate findings effectively.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Conducting EDA to identify patterns and guide further analysis.
- **Machine Learning Basics**: Introduction to machine learning concepts, including simple and multiple linear regression, decision trees, and random forests.
- **Advanced Machine Learning Techniques**: Implementing and understanding decision trees and random forests to enhance predictive accuracy and model robustness.
